Simple prometheus port scan discoverer

This simple package will scan one or more IPv4 subnets for prometheus
exporters and generate a service discovery file suitable to be included
in a file_sd_config section.

INSTALLATION

We are using Perl Carton
(https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Carton/script/carton) as the
module dependency manager. See the link for installation instructions
for Carton. Most modern OSes can get Carton as a prebuilt package. E.g.
in FreeBSD one can install it with "pkg install p5-carton". After
installing Carton, go to the source directory of this package and run
"carton". That's all there is to it. Carton will read cpanfile and
install dependencies into a local/ directory.

USAGE

To discover all prometheus targets in a subnet, use something like:

./scan -f previous-sd-file.yaml 10.11.12.13/16 10.14.15.16/16. The
scanner will try to connect to Prometheus well known exporter numbers
and detect if anybody is listening. The scanner will also look for
targets mentioned in previous-sd-file.yaml and any of them not present
in the detected ones will be also included. So, if one has manually
entered a couple of targets in the previous file, those targets can be
preerved. The scanner will output a YAML structure in STDOUT, redirect
as necessary. Be careful not to clobber the previous file, use an
intermediary if replacing the same file!
